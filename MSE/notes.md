Session-4: 15th Feb 2023, 9.00 am to 11.00 am
Why are systems vulnerable: There are two main reasons for systems being vulnerable—misconfiguration and incorrect programming practices.
[1] What is Vulnerability Assessment (VA)?
[2] Why we need VA-     WITH INDUSTRY COMPLIANCE AND INFORMATION SECURITY laws and mandates
being introduced, the need for conducting a vulnerability and risk assessment is now paramount.
[3] Security Risk (R) = Vulnerability x Asset x Threat
Vulnerability Assessment
Asset Inventory

HIPAA—Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,
http://aspe.hhs.gov/admnsimp/pl104191.htm.
GLBA—Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,

[7] IT Assets
[8] Risk Assessment Best Practices
[9] Technical Assessment and Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)
[10] Benefits of VAPT: 
Helps identify programming errors that can lead to cyber attacks
Provides a methodical approach to risk management
Secures IT networks from internal and external attacks
Secures applications from business logic flaws
Increased ROI on IT security
Protects the organisation from loss of reputation and money 
[11] What is Penetration Testing (PT): It is a proof-of-concept approach to actually explore and exploitvulnerabilities. This process confirms whether the vulnerability really exists and further proves that exploiting it can result in damage to the application or network.
[12] Types of PT: White-box, Black-box and Gray-box testing
[13] Difference between VA and PT:
The VA process gives a horizontal map into the security position of the network and the application, while the PT
process does a vertical deep dive into the findings.
[14] VAPT Process: NetVAPT, WebVAPT, CloudVAPT and IoTVAPT
[15] VAPT Tools: 
Nmap
Acunetix
Nessus
OpenVAS
Nexpose
BurpSuite (PT)
Metasploit (PT)
[16] Automated Vs Manual VAPT
[17] NetworkVAPT Process: Connect IP Address -->Scan Ports (UDP/TCP)--->Map Services--->Find/Exploit Vulnerability --->Report Vulnerability
[18] WebVAPT Process: Open Browser Instance ----> Simulate User ---> Run Hacking Scripts ---> Capture the output --->Find/Exploit the Vulnerability ---> Report Vulnerability

Session-7: Cyber Defense 9 to 11 am 8th March 2023
[1] What is cyber defense?
Cyber-attacks continue to rise in size, frequency, and complexity, so cyber defense is one of the most integral and complex pieces of any organization’s cybersecurity strategy. 
Cyber defense is a coordinated act of resistance that guards information, systems, and networks against cyber attacks by implementing protective procedures such as firewalls, network detection and response (NDR), and endpoint detection and response (EDR) to identify, analyze, and report incidents that occur within a network. 
Still, cyber defense teams are faced with a near impossible task of securing all an organization’s vulnerabilities, and a big part of that means being able to deeply understand the tactics, capabilities, and motives of attackers.
[2] 3-Security Goals (CIA), 4-Classes of cyber attacks (Interception, Interruption, Modification, and Fabrication), 2-Attack types (Active/Passive),5-Security services (Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, Nonrepudiation, Access control, and Authentication Exchange) and 8-Security mechanisms (Encipherment, Data Integrity, Authentication, Access Control, Notarization, Routing Control, Digital Signature, Traffic padding)
[3] Interrelationships between security services and security mechanisms
[4] Implementing cost-effective security solutions
[5] 3 x 3 Matrix of Security Controls and Security Functions (Physical/Technical/Administrative and Preventive, Detective, Corrective functions)
[6] NIST- Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) : Prevent, Detect, Deter, Deflect, Compensate, React/Survive
BCP, IRP etc
[7] Building Robust  Security Systems (DevOps- ZDT, Scaling) and DevSecOps
[8] Risk Mitigation
[9] Roles and Responsibilities of Security Engineer
[10] Defense-in-Depth Strategy (DiD)- Multilayered Security (MLS)
[11]  Multilayered Approach: 1st Line of Defense (Firewall), 2nd Line of Defense (IDS) and 3rd Line of Defense (Data Analytics- AIML Driven)
[12] FAIR- Factor Analysis Information Risk
[13] Intrusion/Intrusion Detection/Intrusion Detection System, Classification based on function Signature-based and Anamoly detection 
[14] Security Events (EoI), Security Alerts (Alarms), and Security Incidents (IoC)
